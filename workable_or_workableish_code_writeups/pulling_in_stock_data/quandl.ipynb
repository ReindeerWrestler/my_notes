    "Free to use (rate limited)\n",
    "Datasets can be downloaded\n",

    "Good API documentation\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "Limited OHLC data\n",
    "No real-time or delayed data for stocks\n",
    "A limited number of free datasets\n",
    "Free API access for non-rate limited use (or freer access at least)\n",
    "Quandl is one of the largest data providers in the world. Their self-confessed mission is the “inspire customers to make new discoveries and incorporate them into trading strategies.” They’ve been around since 2013 and offer millions of free datasets. Yes, millions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2018 they were acquired by NASDAQ and have continued to remain an authority on financial data ranging from equities and futures to options, currencies, and other non-financial market data such as housing, energy, and agriculture.\n",
    "Quandl offers official APIs to access any public dataset for free. Here we’ll see how to get OHLC data via the official Quandl python library and also via the pandas-datareader. One important note is that the free Quandl OHLC data only goes up to 2018 at the time of this article’s writing. If you need more recent data and don’t want to pay this source isn’t for you."
